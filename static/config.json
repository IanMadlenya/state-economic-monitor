New Hampshire's 14.0 percent increase was the largest of any state. A corporate income tax revenue increase and insurance premium tax revenue in the second quarter of 2015 boosted its total. Typically, New Hampshire only reports insurance premium revenue in the first quarter of the year so these data should be used with caution. The next-highest real total tax revenue increases were in California (11.0 percent), Iowa (9.0 percent), and Utah (8.6 percent). Alaska's 73.6 percent decline was a substantial outlier. Both Alaskan oil production and the price of oil have fallen and greatly affected the state's total tax revenue. Specifically, in the past four quarters Alaska's real severance tax revenue was $151 million. In the four quarters before that period\u2014second quarter of 2013 to the second quarter of 2014\u2014Alaska's real severance tax revenue was $2.5 <em>billion</em>. Only two other states saw real total tax revenue decline over the past year: North Dakota (-4.8 percent) and Illinois (-2.3 percent). North Dakota's real total revenue declined despite increased sales and individual income tax revenue because, like Alaska, it suffered from decreased severance tax revenue. Lower individual income tax revenue in Illinois drove its overall decline (see income tax section below). "
