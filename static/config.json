As we\u2019ve <a href = \"http://apps.urban.org/features/state-economic-monitor/historical.html\" target=\"_blank\"> seen over the past year</a>, states that rely heavily on taxes on natural resource extraction (i.e., severance taxes) in particular continue to experience losses as oil and natural gas prices fall. New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming all saw total state revenues drop over the past year. And because the natural resource industry is so pervasive in these states, many also saw declines in sales, individual income, and corporate income taxes. The state with the largest real tax revenue growth was also resource dependent: Alaska (19.4 percent). This reflects changes to <a href = \"http://gov.alaska.gov/newsroom/2016/06/governor-walker-vetoes-1-29-billion-to-preserve-state-savings/\" target=\"_blank\">tax credit rules</a> that helped raise revenue, but also that Alaska\u2019s revenues finally bottomed out after a few years of precipitous decline: the state\u2019s total tax revenue over the past four quarters is only a fifth of what is was in 2013. After Alaska, four additional states had tax revenue increases of more than 6.0 percent: Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, and Washington. Increased sales tax revenue mostly drove gains in Nevada and Washington, while increased income tax revenue was the main driver in Georgia and South Carolina. All those states, except Nevada (see next section), did not significantly change their tax laws over the past year. "
