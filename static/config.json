Total employment increased in all but three states: West Virginia (-2.6 percent), North Dakota (-0.7 percent), and Alaska (-0.4 percent). West Virginia\u2019s decline was mostly the result of a decline in government employment (see the next section), but the state also lost jobs in the mining and construction sectors. The largest increase in employment was in Utah (4.0 percent). Utah had significant employment growth in three sectors: leisure and hospitality, education and health services, and professional services. Employment grew 3.0 percent or more over the past 12 months in six additional states: Oregon (3.5 percent), Florida and Nevada (both 3.3 percent), Washington (3.2 percent), and California and South Carolina (both 3.0 percent)."

In total, government employment declined in 17 states over the year ending in August. The largest increase in public-sector employment was in Indiana (3.6 percent). The state\u2019s total employment increased 2.5 percent over the year. Public-sector employment also increased more than 3.0 percent in two other states: Idaho (3.4 percent) and Missouri (3.1 percent). Only one state, North Dakota, had an increase in government jobs (0.9 percent) and a decrease in total employment (-0.7 percent)."

Real individual income tax revenue declined over the past year in Illinois (-5.0 percent) and Idaho (-4.4 percent).

New Hampshire's 14.0 percent increase was the largest of any state. A corporate income tax revenue increase and insurance premium tax revenue in the second quarter of 2015 boosted its total. Typically, New Hampshire only reports insurance premium revenue in the first quarter of the year so these data should be used with caution. The next-highest real total tax revenue increases were in California (11.0 percent), Iowa (9.0 percent), and Utah (8.6 percent). Alaska's 73.6 percent decline was a substantial outlier. Both Alaskan oil production and the price of oil have fallen and greatly affected the state's total tax revenue. Specifically, in the past four quarters Alaska's real severance tax revenue was $151 million. In the four quarters before that period\u2014second quarter of 2013 to the second quarter of 2014\u2014Alaska's real severance tax revenue was $2.5 <em>billion</em>. Only two other states saw real total tax revenue decline over the past year: North Dakota (-4.8 percent) and Illinois (-2.3 percent). North Dakota's real total revenue declined despite increased sales and individual income tax revenue because, like Alaska, it suffered from decreased severance tax revenue. Lower individual income tax revenue in Illinois drove its overall decline (see income tax section below). "
