This was the first quarter since the fourth quarter of 2014 that national state tax revenue did not increase more than 1.0 percent compared with the previous year. The slow growth was anticipated: state forecasts for fiscal year 2016 estimated about <a href = \"http://www.urban.org/research/publication/prepping-new-session-end-summer-reading-state-budget-analysts-0\">1.5 percent growth</a>. Among the states, changes in total tax revenue ranged from North Dakota\u2019s 32.8 percent decrease to Georgia\u2019s 7.9 percent increase. In total, 15 states had total tax revenue losses over the year. As we\u2019ve <a href = \"http://apps.urban.org/features/state-economic-monitor/historical.html\" target=\"_blank\">seen over the past year</a>, states that rely heavily on taxes on natural resource extraction (i.e., severance taxes) in particular continue to experience losses as oil and natural gas prices fall. Alaska, Louisiana, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming all saw total state revenue drop over the past year. And because the natural resource industry is so pervasive in those states, many also saw declines in sales, individual income, and corporate income taxes. The declines were especially large in North Dakota in part because <a href = \"https://www.nd.gov/tax/data/upfiles/media/Income%20Tax%20Newsletter%20(January%202016).pdf?20160920131512\">lawmakers cut the state's individual income tax and corporate income tax</a>. Illinois, which <a href = \"http://www.revenue.state.il.us/Publications/Bulletins/2015/FY-2015-09.pdf\">reduced its income tax rate</a>, in January 2015, was the only non-resource-dependent state with a large total tax revenue decline. After Georgia, four states all had tax revenue increases of 6.0 percent: Hawaii, Indiana, Tennessee, and Washington. Increased sales tax revenue mostly drove gains in Hawaii, Tennessee, and Washington; increased income tax revenue was the main driver in Georgia and Indiana. None of those states significantly changed their tax laws over the past year."
