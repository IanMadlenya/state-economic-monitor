                            <div class="explainerText"><p>National <a href = "http://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/state-and-local-revenues" target="_blank">state tax revenue</a> decreased 0.8 percent in real terms during the four quarters of 2016 compared with one year earlier. Tax revenue still increased nominally over the year (0.4 percent). The final quarter of 2016 was the <a href = "http://apps.urban.org/features/state-economic-monitor/historical.html" target="_blank">second consecutive quarter </a> that real national state tax revenue declined. This is consistent with <a href = "http://www.nasbo.org/mainsite/reports-data/fiscal-survey-of-states" target="_blank">many states reporting</a> that total revenue for fiscal year 2017 (which began in July 2016 for most states) is coming in below estimates. Overall, 23 states had lower real tax revenues in calendar year 2016 than in 2015. The largest decline was in North Dakota (-26.1 percent). Other states that rely heavily on natural resource extraction taxes (such as Wyoming, Oklahoma, and West Virginia) continued to experience large declines as well. Some non-resource-dependent states, such as Illinois, Maine, Montana, and New York, however, also saw real tax revenue declines greater than 3.0 percent, mostly because of declines in income tax revenues (though only <a href = "http://www.maine.gov/revenue/rules/legischange16.htm#individual" target="_blank">Maine</a> enacted income tax cuts last year). The state with the largest real tax revenue growth was Alaska (45.6 percent). This reflects changes to <a href = "http://gov.alaska.gov/newsroom/2016/06/governor-walker-vetoes-1-29-billion-to-preserve-state-savings/" target="_blank">tax credit rules</a>that helped raise revenues after years of precipitous decline. Even with that recent increase, however, the state’s total tax revenue in 2016 was only a quarter of what it was in 2013. The next highest real total tax revenue increases were in Nevada (9.7 percent) and Louisiana (9.1 percent). Higher sales tax revenue drove the total tax increase in both states (see below).</p>

                       <p>National general sales tax revenue increased 0.7 percent in real terms for the year ending in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with one year earlier. Among the 45 states that levy <a href = "http://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-local-finance-initiative/projects/state-and-local-backgrounders/sales-taxes" target="_blank">general sales tax</a>, revenue declined in 17 states. The largest decline was in North Dakota (-22.8 percent); other resource-dependent states (such as Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming) also saw large drops in sales tax revenue. The largest sales tax revenue increases were in Louisiana (22.9 percent) and Nevada (13.9 percent). Last year <a href = "http://lfo.louisiana.gov/files/revenue/2016_ES1_REC_bills.pdf" target="_blank">Louisiana</a> increased its sales tax rate from 4 percent to 5 percent and applied the tax to more purchases as a part of <a href = "http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/legislature/article_2bfeb820-fb05-11e6-ae7a-6b9e7ca812cf.html" target="_blank">ongoing</a> efforts to address its budget deficit. Nevada enacted  a <a href = "https://tax.nv.gov/WelcometoCOM/" target="_blank">gross receipts tax</a> as part of a larger <a href = "http://gov.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/govnvgov/Content/News_and_Media/Press/2015_Images_and_Files/NevadaRevenuePlan.pdf" target="_blank">education spending bill</a> last year, and the US Census Bureau counts those receipts as sales tax revenue. Utah’s sales tax revenue increased 9.0 percent over the year, but the state did not legislate any tax changes during the period. </p>

DC and 13 of the 41 states with a broad-based income tax (New Hampshire taxes only interest and dividends, and Tennessee taxes only bond interest and stock dividends) had real income tax revenue decreases over the year. The largest decline was in North Dakota (-34.9 percent), a state that <a href = "https://www.nd.gov/tax/data/upfiles/media/Income Tax Newsletter (January 2016).pdf?20160920131512" target="_blank">recently cut tax rates</a> and is struggling economically as oil and natural gas production falls, taking  wages and income down with it. Individual income tax revenue also fell 5 percent or more in Illinois, Iowa, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. Three of these states, Illinois,
<a href = "http://www.tax.ohio.gov/Portals/0/communications/news_releases/FilingseasonopensNR.pdf" target="_blank">Ohio</a>, and <a href = "http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/oklahoma-pulls-trigger-unaffordable-tax-cut" target="_blank">Oklahoma</a>, all recently reduced income tax rates. The largest increases in individual income tax revenue were in Indiana (17.1 percent), Michigan (9.8 percent), and South Carolina (9.8 percent). None of those states significantly changed its income tax over the past two years.</p>

In the 44 states with a broad-based corporate income tax (Nevada, Ohio, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming do not tax corporate income; South Dakota taxes only financial institutions), real revenue declined in 34 states. The largest decline was in New Mexico (-45.2 percent). State corporate income tax revenue is always volatile: profits fluctuate, the timing of tax payments change as states offer amnesty programs, and current profits can be offset against prior losses. But the largest increase compared with last year is off the chart: Louisiana’s corporate income tax revenue was 1,210.6 percent higher in 2016 than 2015 because of changes in state law. For much of 2015, the <a href = "https://www.businessreport.com/article/louisiana-corporate-franchise-tax-collections-back-black">state paid more in credits</a> than it collected in tax revenue, reflecting corporate tax rules and declining prices for natural resources. The <a href = "https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=985189">state passed reforms in 2016</a>that ensured the tax would bring in more revenue. Consequently, Louisiana collected roughly $20 million in corporate income tax revenue in 2015 and $270 million in 2016. </p>
