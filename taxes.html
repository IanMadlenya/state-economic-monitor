                            <div class="explainerText"><p>National real total <a href = "http://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/state-and-local-revenues" target="_blank">state tax revenue</a> increased 0.5 percent in the year ending in the second quarter of 2016—the end of the fiscal year for most states—compared with one year earlier. This was the first quarter since the fourth quarter of 2014 that national state tax revenue did not increase more than 1.0 percent compared with the previous year. The slow growth was anticipated: state forecasts for fiscal year 2016 estimated about <a href = "http://www.urban.org/research/publication/prepping-new-session-end-summer-reading-state-budget-analysts-0">1.5 percent growth</a>. Among the states, changes in total tax revenue ranged from North Dakota’s 32.8 percent decrease to Georgia’s 7.9 percent increase. In total, 15 states had total tax revenue losses over the year. As we’ve <a href = "http://apps.urban.org/features/state-economic-monitor/historical.html" target="_blank">seen over the past year</a>, states that rely heavily on taxes on natural resource extraction (i.e., severance taxes) in particular continue to experience losses as oil and natural gas prices fall. Alaska, Louisiana, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming all saw total state revenue drop over the past year. And because the natural resource industry is so pervasive in those states, many also saw declines in sales, individual income, and corporate income taxes. The declines were especially large in North Dakota in part because <a href = "https://www.nd.gov/tax/data/upfiles/media/Income%20Tax%20Newsletter%20(January%202016).pdf?20160920131512">lawmakers cut the state's individual income tax and corporate income tax</a>. Illinois, which <a href = "http://www.revenue.state.il.us/Publications/Bulletins/2015/FY-2015-09.pdf">reduced its income tax rate</a>, in January 2015, was the only non-resource-dependent state with a large total tax revenue decline. After Georgia, four states all had tax revenue increases of 6.0 percent: Hawaii, Indiana, Tennessee, and Washington. Increased sales tax revenue mostly drove gains in Hawaii, Tennessee, and Washington; increased income tax revenue was the main driver in Georgia and Indiana. None of those states significantly changed their tax laws over the past year.</p>

The largest revenue declines were in North Dakota (-16.5 percent), Oklahoma (-8.5 percent), and Texas (-4.3 percent), three states with economies dependent on natural resources. The largest sales tax revenue increase, however, was in Wyoming (7.9 percent), which is also resource dependent and had an overall tax revenue decline. In addition to Wyoming, sales tax revenue increased more than 6.0 percent in DC, Hawaii, and Tennessee. </p>

DC and 13 of the 41 states with a broad-based income tax (New Hampshire taxes only interest and dividends, and Tennessee taxes only bond interest and stock dividends) had real income tax revenue decreases over the year. The largest decline was in North Dakota (-34.9 percent), a state that <a href = "https://www.nd.gov/tax/data/upfiles/media/Income Tax Newsletter (January 2016).pdf?20160920131512" target="_blank">recently cut tax rates</a> and is struggling economically as oil and natural gas production falls, taking  wages and income down with it. Individual income tax revenue also fell 5 percent or more in Illinois, Iowa, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. Three of these states, Illinois,
<a href = "http://www.tax.ohio.gov/Portals/0/communications/news_releases/FilingseasonopensNR.pdf" target="_blank">Ohio</a>, and <a href = "http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/oklahoma-pulls-trigger-unaffordable-tax-cut" target="_blank">Oklahoma</a>, all recently reduced income tax rates.

Thirty-three states saw real revenue decreases over the past year.
