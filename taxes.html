Total tax revenue declined in six states. Connecticut, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin experienced declines of 5 percent or less, but Alaska’s revenue plummeted 49.8 percent. Alaska relies on tax revenue from oil production far more than any other state and falling Alaskan oil production greatly affected the state’s total tax revenue. Wyoming (11.2 percent) experienced the largest increase in total tax revenue during the year. Wyoming benefited from oil production and related increases in severance tax revenue, much like two other states with notable total tax revenue increases: New Mexico (7 percent) and North Dakota (4.5 percent). Despite the recent collapse in oil prices, the average oil price was higher during the first three quarters of 2014 than in 2013. Thus, total tax revenue for these energy states may look very different in future quarters. Colorado (7.6 percent), Oregon (7.2 percent), and Arizona (7.1 percent) also showed revenue increases of 7 percent or more compared with the previous year. </p>

Three states saw sales tax revenue fall: Minnesota (-11.1 percent), Virginia (-2.5 percent), and West Virginia (-0.4 percent). Above average revenue in the first quarter of 2013 caused Minnesota’s decline, while tax administration changes contributed to Virginia’s drop.
