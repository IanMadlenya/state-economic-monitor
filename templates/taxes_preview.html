Total tax revenue increased over the past year in 41 states and the District of Columbia (DC). Of the nine states with revenue losses, eight (Alaska, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming) rely on natural resource extraction. The average price of oil in 2015 was half the price it was in 2014, severely affecting energy states. Related, Alaska, Louisiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Wyoming were the only six states with <a href = "http://apps.urban.org/features/state-economic-monitor/employment.html">total unemployment declines</a> over the past year. The largest revenue decline was in Alaska (-64.9 percent). Illinois, which <a href = "http://www.revenue.state.il.us/Publications/Bulletins/2015/FY-2015-09.pdf">reduced its income tax rate</a> in January 2015, was the only non-resource-dependent state with a revenue decline. Meanwhile, Iowa’s 15.8 percent total tax revenue increase over the year was the largest of any state. The state saw substantial revenue growth from both its general sales tax and individual income tax—neither tax was substantially changed by law in the past two years. Iowa did <a href = "https://tax.iowa.gov/iowa-fuel-tax-rate-changes-effective-july-1-2015">raise its motor fuel taxes</a> in summer 2015 and consequently collected more revenue (but not as much new revenue as from the sales and income tax over the year). The next highest growth was in 11.9 percent in both Delaware and North Carolina. Overall, total tax revenue grew more than 5 percent in 24 states and DC.</p>

The largest revenue declines were in Oklahoma (-4.1 percent) and South Carolina (-3.9 percent). We do not know specifically what caused these declines—there were no rate decreases, for example—but South Carolina’s loss might be an <a href = "http://rfa.sc.gov/files/December 2015 General Fund Revenue Tables_0.pdf" target="_blank">an accounting issue</a>. The largest revenue increases were in <a href = "http://www.dom.state.ia.us/state/files/FY16/December2015GFR.pdf" target="_blank">Iowa</a> (19.3 percent) and Maine (14.3 percent).

Thirty-eight of the 41 states with a broad-based income tax (New Hampshire taxes only interest and dividends, and Tennessee taxes only bond interest and stock dividends) had real revenue increase over the year. The three states with decreased revenue were Illinois (-13.4 percent), Kansas (-1.6 percent), and Arkansas (-1.4 percent). In <a href = "http://www.revenue.state.il.us/Publications/Bulletins/2015/FY-2015-09.pdf" target="_blank">January 2015</a>, a temporary tax hike expired in Illinois, and its rate fell from 5 percent to 3.75 percent. As a result, the state’s 2015 income tax revenue was $2 billion lower than in 2014 (and the state still has not <a href = "http://www.governing.com/topics/politics/gov-illinois-bruce-rauner-budget.html" target="_blank">not passed a budget</a>.

On the other side of the spectrum, North Carolina, a state that <a href = "http://www.dor.state.nc.us/taxes/individual/ind_whatsnew.html">cut its income tax rate from 5.80 percent to 5.75 percent</a> at the beginning of 2015, saw its income tax revenue increase 19.6 percent over the year.

In the 44 states with a broad corporate income tax (Nevada, Ohio, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming do not tax corporate income; South Dakota only taxes financial institutions), real revenue changes ranged from a 95.7 percent decline in Louisiana—the state is struggling with both low receipts from oil companies and <a href = "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-louisiana-budget-politics-insight-idUSKCN0WA2OG">owed tax subsidies</a>—to a 50.9 percent increase in Delaware. Real corporate tax revenue increased over the past year in 26 states and DC. These data highlight that state corporate income tax revenue is highly volatile—profits fluctuate, the timing of tax payments change, and states offer amnesty programs.</p>
